## Codility Scores
This repository contains scores of 30 Codility practice problems from their web site.
The scores are located in the resources/scores directory. The scores shown are the
total scores which are based on a correctness score and a performance score. The
correctness scores for all 30 problems are 100%. Total scores of less than 100% are
the result of performance scores that are less than 100%. 

This repository also contains the code that I wrote for 7 of the practice problems.
Links to the task descriptions for those problems are shown below.
